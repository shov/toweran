# Introducing

Toweran is a Nodejs framework for back-end solutions. It's designed to create and grow API and other back-end services. Check the [README](https://github.com/shov/toweran)

We made it so, you can do simple things easy the same time you can scale it up to a serious solution keeping control of the complexity.

The main benefits you might be given using Toweran are a well-structured project and a number of built-in tools that solve run-of-the-mill things.
